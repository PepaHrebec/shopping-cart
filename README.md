  - React Context

- Styled Components

**What I've learnt**  
Genuinely a lot. Getting to know the Context hook helped me get over my prop-drilling addiction and in general forced me to take a closer look at how React "builds" web apps. Another thing I'd like to mention is the usage of Styled Components, at which I'm honestly getting better and better.The most important thing I've managed to learn were the various _media queries_. I've been leaving them on the sidelines for far too long and I consider that a real mistake, but they ended up being pretty simple and enjoyable to use, I can see why mobile-first really took off.  
I'm kinda proud of this little web I made and it's the first one I'm genuinely ok with sharing with my friends, mostly because of the responsible design.‚öõÔ∏è
